## About this Project
The objective of this project was to build a functional full-stack application using Express.js and Node.js. I was given starter code for the front-end of this application and my goal was to create the backend server and connect the two sides together. I did this by creating a server.js file and a routes folder that included two files name html.js and api.js. I used the Express.Router to connect the files and to get the call functions for the server. In the end, I created a functional application that can intake notes from the user and have them stored on the server.
